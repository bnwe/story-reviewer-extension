# Customizable Prompts - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Enable users to customize AI feedback prompts to get more targeted and relevant story improvement suggestions tailored to their specific team standards, processes, and requirements.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Extension sends hardcoded prompts to AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Custom) for story feedback
- Technology stack: JavaScript WebExtensions, existing options page, storage API, multiple AI provider integrations
- Integration points: Options page settings, background script API calls, feedback generation system

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Replace hardcoded prompts with user-configurable prompt templates that can be customized per AI provider
- How it integrates: Extends existing options page with prompt management, integrates with current API call system in background scripts
- Success criteria: Users can create, edit, save custom prompts and see improved, more relevant feedback based on their customizations

## Stories

1. **Story 1: Prompt Management UI** - Add prompt customization interface to the options page with default templates, edit capabilities, and preview functionality

2. **Story 2: Prompt Storage & Retrieval** - Implement secure storage of custom prompts using existing extension storage API and integrate with current settings system

3. **Story 3: Dynamic Prompt Integration** - Modify background script API calls to use custom prompts instead of hardcoded ones, with fallback to defaults

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Users creating invalid prompts that break AI feedback generation
- **Mitigation:** Input validation, prompt testing functionality, and automatic fallback to default prompts on failure

## Definition of Done

- ✓ All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- ✓ Existing functionality verified through testing (current AI feedback still works)
- ✓ Integration points working correctly (options page, storage, background scripts)
- ✓ Documentation updated appropriately (README updated with new feature)
- ✓ No regression in existing features (all current tests pass)

## Validation Checklist

**Scope Validation:**
- ✓ Enhancement follows existing patterns (extends options page, uses storage API)
- ✓ Integration complexity is manageable (builds on current AI integration)

**Completeness Check:**
- ✓ Epic goal is clear and achievable
- ✓ Stories are properly scoped (UI, Storage, Integration)
- ✓ Success criteria are measurable (user can customize and see results)
- ✓ Dependencies are identified (existing options system, storage API)

## Story Manager Handoff

**Story Manager Handoff:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing WebExtensions system running JavaScript with Jest testing and ESLint
- Integration points: Options page UI, extension storage API, background script AI calls, existing AI provider system
- Existing patterns to follow: Current options page structure, storage API usage patterns, error handling in background scripts
- Critical compatibility requirements: Must not break existing AI feedback functionality, must work with all current AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Custom)
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering user-customizable AI feedback prompts."
