# Epic: Comprehensive Popup Redesign

## Epic Overview

**Epic Title:** Comprehensive Popup Interface Redesign and Enhancement

**Epic ID:** EPIC-001

**Epic Goal:** Modify functionality of the extension's popup so that users can access the basic get feedback function as well as go to the settings from there. Also help text should be added.

## Existing System Context

### Current Popup Implementation
- **Location:** `/popup/` directory with `popup.html`, `popup.css`, `popup.js`
- **Current Functionality:** Basic content extraction trigger and display
- **Architecture:** Standard Firefox extension popup using Manifest V2
- **Technology Stack:** Vanilla JavaScript, CSS custom properties, HTML5
- **Integration Points:** 
  - Content scripts for Azure DevOps integration
  - Background script for API communication
  - Browser storage for content persistence
  - Options page for configuration

### Current User Flow
1. User opens extension popup
2. User clicks "Extract Content" (if on Azure DevOps work item page)
3. Content is extracted and displayed in basic format
4. User can view last extraction via "View Last Extraction" button

## Enhancement Details

### Enhancement Scope
This epic encompasses a complete redesign of the popup interface across four key dimensions:

#### 1. Visual/UI Enhancements
- Styling is in line with styling of the feedback dialog
- Improved typography and spacing
- Icon integration

#### 2. Functionality Enhancements
- The extraction functionality is not needed anymore
- Instead the button directly opens the get feedback dialog
- addionaly there is a settings button to open the settings of the extension

#### 3. Content Enhancements
- Improved messaging and user guidance

## Stories Breakdown

### Story 1: Button for settings
**Focus:** Offer a button to open the settings page
- The button is a settings icon (use material icon) located in the top right corner of the popup
- When clicked it opens the extensions settings page
- It has a hovertext "Settings"

### Story 2: Exchange buttons
**Focus:** Remove the two buttons for the extraction and replace with one button to get feedback
- The two extraction buttons are removed
- Instead there is one new button (same style as the previsou extract content button) "Get Feedback"
- This button has the same functionality as the injected get feedback button
- Just like the extract button it is only enabled when the current tab is a valid azure devops url
- When the url is not valid, the popup shows a message that the user has to navigate to a valid url

### Story 3: Content
**Focus:** Improve texts in the popup
- When tab is not a valid url the text is changed to "Please navigate to a valid Azure DevOps work item URL. More Info"
- The "More Info" part: When clicked it expands to below and shows detailled information on how the URL must look in order to be valid. It can also be collapsed.

## Compatibility Requirements

### Browser Compatibility
- Maintain Firefox Manifest V2 compatibility
- Ensure Chrome compatibility (existing cross-browser support)
- Test across different browser versions

### Extension Integration
- Preserve existing content script integration
- Maintain background script communication
- Keep storage API usage patterns
- Ensure options page consistency

### Performance Requirements
- Maintain fast popup load times (<200ms)
- Ensure smooth animations (60fps)
- Keep memory usage minimal
- Preserve existing extraction performance

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Low Risk Items
- CSS styling updates (easily reversible)
- Content text changes (no functional impact)
- Visual enhancements (additive changes)

### Medium Risk Items
- New interactive features (thorough testing required)
- JavaScript functionality changes (regression testing needed)
- DOM structure modifications (content script compatibility)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental rollout by story
- Comprehensive testing at each stage
- Backup of original files before modifications
- Feature flags for new functionality
- Rollback plan for each enhancement

## Definition of Done

### Epic Completion Criteria
- [ ] All four enhancement dimensions implemented and tested
- [ ] Visual design is modern and cohesive across all popup states
- [ ] New functionality works reliably with existing extension features
- [ ] Content display and management is significantly improved
- [ ] User interactions are smooth and intuitive
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility maintained
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met or exceeded
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Documentation updated for new features

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Manual testing across target browsers
- [ ] Existing automated tests pass
- [ ] New functionality tested
- [ ] Accessibility standards met
- [ ] Performance regression testing completed
- [ ] User experience validation

## Technical Considerations

### Existing Patterns to Preserve
- Cross-browser API usage (`typeof browser !== 'undefined' ? browser : chrome`)
- CSS custom properties architecture
- Message passing with content scripts
- Storage API usage patterns
- Error handling approaches
