# Story 1.1: Extract User Story Content

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Product Owner,
**I want** the extension to extract the user story content from Azure DevOps,
**so that** I can receive feedback on it.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The extension identifies and extracts the user story content from the current tab.
2. The extracted content is accurately captured for analysis.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Set up Firefox extension project structure (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create manifest.json with required permissions for Azure DevOps access
  - [x] Set up basic extension folder structure
- [x] Implement content script for Azure DevOps integration (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create content script to run on Azure DevOps work item pages
  - [x] Identify and target user story content elements in Azure DevOps DOM
  - [x] Handle different Azure DevOps layouts and work item types
- [x] Develop user story content extraction logic (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Extract title, description, and acceptance criteria fields
  - [x] Handle rich text formatting and HTML content
  - [x] Validate extracted content completeness
- [x] Implement extraction accuracy verification (AC: 2)
  - [x] Add content validation to ensure complete extraction
  - [x] Handle edge cases (empty fields, special characters)
  - [x] Add error handling for extraction failures
- [x] Add unit tests for extraction functionality
  - [x] Test DOM element identification logic
  - [x] Test content extraction accuracy
  - [x] Test error handling scenarios

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the first story in the project.

### Technical Context
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#key-components]
- **Browser Extension Architecture**: Standard Firefox extension development using JavaScript, no frameworks required
- **Integration Target**: Azure DevOps work item pages, requires DOM extraction capabilities
- **Data Flow**: Extension extracts content â†’ processes for API transmission

### Technology Stack
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#technology-stack]
- **Language**: JavaScript (standard browser extension development)
- **Framework**: None (vanilla JavaScript)
- **UI Library**: None (minimal UI for this story)
- **Styling**: CSS for basic styling

### Integration Requirements
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#integration-points]
- **Azure DevOps Compatibility**: Must extract user story content from current tab
- **Content Extraction**: Must handle Azure DevOps UI and data structure variations
- **Manual Initiation**: User manually initiates the feedback process (not automatic)

### UX Requirements
[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#user-flows]
- **Entry Point**: Extension accessible while viewing a user story in Azure DevOps
- **Manual Process**: User clicks button/link to start extraction process
- **Success Criteria**: Content accurately extracted and ready for analysis

### Project Structure Notes
No specific project structure guidance found in architecture docs for Firefox extension layout. Standard extension structure will be used:
- `/manifest.json` - Extension manifest
- `/content/` - Content scripts
- `/background/` - Background scripts (if needed)

### Testing
[Source: Configuration and standard Firefox extension practices]
- **Test file location**: `/tests/` directory
- **Testing approach**: Unit tests for extraction logic, manual testing on Azure DevOps
- **Test standards**: Standard JavaScript testing practices
- **Testing requirements**: Verify DOM extraction accuracy and error handling
