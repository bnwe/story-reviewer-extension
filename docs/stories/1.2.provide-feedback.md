# Story 1.2: Provide Feedback

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Product Owner,
**I want** the extension to provide feedback on my user story,
**so that** I can improve its quality.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can configure their LLM API key through extension settings.
2. The extension sends the extracted content to the LLM via REST API using the configured API key.
3. The feedback is displayed to the user in a clear and actionable format.
4. Users can copy feedback snippets to the clipboard.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/1.1.extract-user-story-content.md#dev-agent-record]
- Complete Firefox extension infrastructure already exists with manifest v2
- Content extraction system is robust with multiple DOM selector fallbacks
- Button positioning is inline left of search field in Azure DevOps page
- Rich text content handling implemented for various Azure DevOps editor types
- Comprehensive test suite structure established (37 existing tests)
- Popup UI system already in place for user interaction

### Technical Context
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#key-components]
- **REST API Client**: Must send extracted content to LLM and receive feedback with asynchronous handling support
- **LLM Server Integration**: External LLM service (e.g., OpenAI API) for user story analysis
- **Separate Browser Window**: Feedback display in separate window, not popup, to remain open as needed

### Technology Stack
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#technology-stack]
- **Language**: JavaScript (standard browser extension development)
- **Framework**: None (vanilla JavaScript)
- **API Communication**: REST API for LLM integration
- **UI Library**: None (build on existing popup infrastructure)
- **Styling**: CSS for feedback display formatting

### API Integration Requirements
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#integration-points]
- **LLM API**: Define API endpoints and authentication methods
- **API Usage Compliance**: Ensure compliance with API usage limits and data privacy
- **Long-Running Query Handling**: Implement asynchronous API calls with loading indicators
- **Security**: Secure communication between extension and LLM API

### UX Requirements
[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#user-flows]
- **Manual Process**: User manually initiates feedback process (builds on existing extraction flow)
- **Settings UI**: Separate browser extension options page for API key configuration
- **Separate Browser Window**: Opens in separate window for persistent access, not popup
- **Accessibility**: Compliance with accessibility standards for all users
- **Feedback Display**: Clear and actionable format with copy functionality
- **Visual Consistency**: Align with Azure DevOps styling for seamless experience

### Project Structure Notes
[Source: Previous story implementation]
Existing extension structure to build upon:
- `/manifest.json` - Already configured with necessary permissions (may need options_page declaration)
- `/content/` - Content scripts for Azure DevOps integration
- `/background/` - Background scripts for message handling and data storage
- `/popup/` - Existing popup infrastructure to extend
- `/options/` - New directory needed for API key configuration interface
- `/tests/` - Established testing structure with 37 existing tests

### Testing
[Source: Previous story implementation and standard practices]
- **Test file location**: `/tests/` directory (extend existing structure)
- **Testing approach**: Unit tests for API configuration, API client, feedback display, clipboard functionality
- **Integration testing**: Complete user flow from API setup through extraction to feedback display
- **Manual testing**: Real LLM API integration testing with various providers
- **Test standards**: Build on existing 37-test foundation with similar patterns
