# Story 1.2: Provide Feedback

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Product Owner,
**I want** the extension to provide feedback on my user story,
**so that** I can improve its quality.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can configure their LLM API key through extension settings.
2. The extension sends the extracted content to the LLM via REST API using the configured API key.
3. The feedback is displayed to the user in a clear and actionable format.
4. Users can copy feedback snippets to the clipboard.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create API key configuration interface (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Build extension options/settings page for API key input
  - [ ] Implement secure storage of API key in browser extension storage
  - [ ] Add API key validation and connection testing
  - [ ] Provide clear instructions for obtaining API keys from LLM providers
- [ ] Implement REST API client functionality (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create API service module for LLM communication
  - [ ] Implement authentication using stored API key
  - [ ] Add asynchronous request handling for long-running queries
  - [ ] Implement error handling for API failures, authentication errors, and timeouts
- [ ] Develop feedback display interface (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create separate browser window for feedback display
  - [ ] Design and implement feedback text area with clear formatting
  - [ ] Add loading indicators for ongoing processing
  - [ ] Ensure UI can handle and display large text responses efficiently
- [ ] Implement clipboard functionality (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Add copy to clipboard button for feedback snippets
  - [ ] Implement text selection and partial copying capabilities
  - [ ] Add user feedback for successful copy operations
- [ ] Integrate with existing extraction system (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Connect API calls with content extraction from story 1.1
  - [ ] Implement complete user flow from API configuration to feedback display
  - [ ] Ensure compatibility with existing button placement and user interaction
  - [ ] Add graceful handling when API key is not configured
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
  - [ ] Unit tests for API key configuration and storage
  - [ ] Unit tests for API client functionality
  - [ ] Unit tests for feedback display components
  - [ ] Unit tests for clipboard functionality
  - [ ] Integration tests for complete user flow including configuration
  - [ ] Manual testing with real LLM API responses

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: docs/stories/1.1.extract-user-story-content.md#dev-agent-record]
- Complete Firefox extension infrastructure already exists with manifest v2
- Content extraction system is robust with multiple DOM selector fallbacks
- Button positioning is inline left of search field in Azure DevOps page
- Rich text content handling implemented for various Azure DevOps editor types
- Comprehensive test suite structure established (37 existing tests)
- Popup UI system already in place for user interaction

### Technical Context
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#key-components]
- **REST API Client**: Must send extracted content to LLM and receive feedback with asynchronous handling support
- **LLM Server Integration**: External LLM service (e.g., OpenAI API) for user story analysis
- **Separate Browser Window**: Feedback display in separate window, not popup, to remain open as needed

### Technology Stack
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#technology-stack]
- **Language**: JavaScript (standard browser extension development)
- **Framework**: None (vanilla JavaScript)
- **API Communication**: REST API for LLM integration
- **UI Library**: None (build on existing popup infrastructure)
- **Styling**: CSS for feedback display formatting

### API Integration Requirements
[Source: docs/fullstack-architecture.md#integration-points]
- **LLM API**: Define API endpoints and authentication methods
- **API Usage Compliance**: Ensure compliance with API usage limits and data privacy
- **Long-Running Query Handling**: Implement asynchronous API calls with loading indicators
- **Security**: Secure communication between extension and LLM API

### UX Requirements
[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#user-flows]
- **Manual Process**: User manually initiates feedback process (builds on existing extraction flow)
- **Settings UI**: Separate browser extension options page for API key configuration
- **Separate Browser Window**: Opens in separate window for persistent access, not popup
- **Accessibility**: Compliance with accessibility standards for all users
- **Feedback Display**: Clear and actionable format with copy functionality
- **Visual Consistency**: Align with Azure DevOps styling for seamless experience

### Project Structure Notes
[Source: Previous story implementation]
Existing extension structure to build upon:
- `/manifest.json` - Already configured with necessary permissions (may need options_page declaration)
- `/content/` - Content scripts for Azure DevOps integration
- `/background/` - Background scripts for message handling and data storage
- `/popup/` - Existing popup infrastructure to extend
- `/options/` - New directory needed for API key configuration interface
- `/tests/` - Established testing structure with 37 existing tests

### Testing
[Source: Previous story implementation and standard practices]
- **Test file location**: `/tests/` directory (extend existing structure)
- **Testing approach**: Unit tests for API configuration, API client, feedback display, clipboard functionality
- **Integration testing**: Complete user flow from API setup through extraction to feedback display
- **Manual testing**: Real LLM API integration testing with various providers
- **Test standards**: Build on existing 37-test foundation with similar patterns
