**1. High-Level Architecture**

- **Technical Summary:**
  - The architecture will support a Firefox extension that extracts user story content from Azure DevOps, sends it to an LLM via REST API, and displays feedback in a separate browser window. It will handle long-running queries and large responses efficiently.

- **Architecture Style:**
  - **Client-Server Model:** The extension acts as a client, interacting with a server-side LLM via REST API.

- **Key Components:**
  1. **Browser Extension:** 
     - Extracts user story content from Azure DevOps.
     - Opens a separate browser window for feedback display.
  2. **REST API Client:**
     - Sends extracted content to the LLM.
     - Receives and processes feedback.
     - Supports asynchronous handling of long-running queries.
  3. **LLM Server:**
     - Analyzes user story content and provides feedback.

**2. Technology Stack**

- **Frontend:**
  - **Language:** JavaScript
  - **Framework:** None (standard browser extension development)
  - **UI Library:** None (minimal UI for feedback display)
  - **Styling:** CSS for basic styling

- **Backend:**
  - **API Communication:** REST API
  - **LLM Integration:** External LLM service (e.g., OpenAI API)

**3. Component Interactions**

- **Data Flow:**
  1. User opens a user story in Azure DevOps.
  2. User manually initiates the feedback process via the extension.
  3. Extension extracts story content and sends it to the LLM via REST API.
  4. LLM analyzes content and returns feedback.
  5. Extension displays feedback in a separate browser window.

- **Handling Long-Running Queries:**
  - Implement asynchronous API calls to handle long response times.
  - Use loading indicators to inform users of ongoing processing.
  - Ensure the UI can handle and display large text responses efficiently.

**4. Integration Points**

- **Azure DevOps:**
  - Extract user story content from the current tab.
  - Ensure compatibility with Azure DevOps UI and data structure.

- **LLM API:**
  - Define API endpoints and authentication methods.
  - Ensure compliance with API usage limits and data privacy.

**5. Security Considerations**

- Ensure secure communication between the extension and LLM API.
- Handle user data with care, adhering to data privacy regulations.

**6. Deployment and Operations**

- **Extension Deployment:**
  - Package and distribute via Firefox Add-ons site.
- **API Hosting:**
  - Host the LLM API on a reliable cloud platform.
